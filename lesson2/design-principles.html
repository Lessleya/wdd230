          There are a many aspects of good web design, and whitespace is
          certainly one of them. Whitespace is the empty space around design
          elements such as images, text, columns, etc. It is that blank space
          that makes layouts clean and sophisticated.

          <h3>Amazon - Fitts Law</h3>
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/">www.amazon.co.au</a>
          <img
            class="amazon_pic"

            alt="Screenshot Amazon website"/>
        <p>
            Fitts' law states that the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer 
            (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target area is a function of the distance to the target 
            divided by the size of the target. Thus, the longer the distance and the smaller the 
            target's size, the longer it takes. Because this is a commercial (shop) website, 
            the ability to quickly quick from an item, and be presented with lots of items at 
            once is important.

        <p>
          The rule of thirds is a "rule of thumb" for composing visual images
          such as designs, films, paintings, and photographs. The guideline
          proposes that an image should be imagined as divided into nine equal
          parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced
          vertical lines, and that important compositional elements should be
          placed along these lines or their intersections. The web page should 
          look balanced and pleasing to the eye.
